# COVID_tracker-React-project
Real time COVID tracker for all the countries in the world, using an API to fetch data.

API used: https://covid19.mathdro.id/api

Using ChartJS and Material UI along with react, this project is focused on giving real-time updates of the COVID cases in all the countries of the world, along with precise and detailed information of the number of people infected, number of deaths, number of recoveries and the currently active cases in each country. I have also used ChartJS to create line and bar graphs to represent the infected and dead in a graphical format.

Setup:run npm i && npm start in terminal to run this project
